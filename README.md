# QA-portfolio
QA-portfolio is testing project for the mobile application PetsMeet on a real device. 
By simulating real-world scenarios and user interactions, I successfully validated the app's compatibility with iOS. 
Testing was performed on a real device, iPhone 8, iOS v. 16.6.
It includes documentation: Test Cases, Improvements, Bug Report and Test Run Report.
