# QA-portfolio
QA-portfolio is testing project for the mobile application PetsMeet on a real device. 

Project Name: PetsMeet Mobile Application & PetsMeet website www.petsmeet.org 

PetsMeet is a social network mobile application for pet owners and animal lovers, where users can create a profile for their pets, connect with other pet owners in their local area and beyond, share photos and videos, participate in a variety of fun and informative discussions, and find and share information about local pet-friendly places.

The PetsMeet website (www.petsmeet.org) has all the information about the application, and detailed information about it can be obtained through the contact form. The site also has direct links to the application on the App Store and Google Play.

By simulating real-world scenarios and user interactions, I successfully validated the app's compatibility with iOS. 
Testing was performed on a real device, iPhone 8, iOS v. 16.6.
It includes documentation: Test Cases, Improvements, Bug Report and Test Run Report.
